-How do I approach designing software?

  1. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  This project has helped me improve my ability to adapt to using precreated code before adding my own code to meet the necessary qualifications.  I learned how to render images, add colors to the vertices of images, add textures to images, and add lighting to images.
  
  2. What design process did you follow for your project work?
    
    First I had to understand the concepts of the code that was already in place, read through the new material that would teach me the new techniques, then apply those techniques to the assignment and my final project.  I did this week by week using agile design techniques to come to the completion of my 3D Scene.
    
  3. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  If I have a job where I have to use, adapt to, or create images and 3D scenes this knowledge will be invaluable.

-How do I approach developing programs?

  1. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  
  Because we had to use multiple different cpp files to complete this assignment I had to know where to create the original functions and, therefore where to apply the extensions of each one of them.
  
  2. How did iteration factor into your development?
  
  When I am working for a company who uses an agile methodology to complete their programs this experience will be extremely helpful because I had to complete the design step by step, week by week.  The first week we learned how to imagine using certain shapes to create objects in a 3D scene.  The second week we learned how to render those images and add color to their vertices.  The third we we learned how create GLFW controls to that our 3D scene could be viewed.  The fourth week we learned how to apply perspective and orthographic views to the project.  The fifth week we learned how to apply textures to each rendered image.  The sixth week we learned how to apply lighting to our 3D scenes.  And the seventh week the project was due so we had to touch up our project with everything we learned.  Every week we had to apply what we learned to an assignment and add that to our final project/3D scene.
  
  3. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
     
  In a way I worked backwards.  I had to understand the requirements of the assignment and final project for the week before I began learning how to apply the techniques.  After that, I read about the general techniques needed to code in openGL for the week which was 2 to 5 sections of reading.  Then I read a document that showed me how what I read could applied to the assignment and final project.  Then I went into getting the coding done.  Preparation was key to completing each assignment.
     
-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  1. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

  The ability to understand the process of creating a project will be extremely useful no matter what class I take moving forward.
     
  2. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I have seen applications for software engineering positions that require you to have knowledge of OpenGL in order to qualify for the position so this will definitely be useful in my future whether it's in general, healthcare, or game software engineering.
